  description: >
    Split allows you to make, get and manage payments using nothing but bank
    accounts.


    It is important to understand that there are 2 main ways Split can be used
    for maximum flexibility:


    1. Between Split accounts.

    2. Between a Split account and anyone.


    Due to the above, certain endpoints and techniques will differ slightly
    depending on who you are interacting with. You can find more on this in the
    [Making payments](/#making-payments) and [Getting paid](/#getting-paid)
    guides.

    ## Try it out

    The best way to familiarise yourself with our API is by interacting with it.


    We've preloaded a collection of all our endpoints for you to use in Postman.
    Before you start, load up our API collection:


    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.postman.co/run-collection/46835ea325243f7bcb26#?env%5BSplit%20Payments%20Public%20Sandbox%5D=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)


    Okay, lets get things setup!


    1. **Create a Split account**

        If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Split account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash)

    2. **Register your application with Split**

        Sign in and create an OAuth2 application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications).

        [![Split OAuth2 app create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_create.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_create.png)

    3. **Generate personal access tokens**

        The quickest way to access your Split account via the API is using
        personal access tokens. Click on your newly created application from your [application
    list](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) and click on
    **+ Personal Access Token**.

        [![Split locate personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)

        _(You'll have the option to give the token a title)_

        [![Split personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)

        <aside class="notice">Please note that personal access tokens do not expire.</aside>

    4. **Use personal access token in Postman**

        You can use this `access_token` to authorise any requests to the
        Split API in Postman by choosing the **Bearer Token** option under
        the **Authorization** tab.

        [![Postman use personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_personal_access_token.png)

    5. **Make an API request!**

        You are now ready to interact with your Split account via the
        API! Go ahead and send a request using Postman.

        [![Postman use personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_request_response.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_request_response.png)



    ## Get started

    This guide will help you setup an OAuth2 app in order to get authenticated &
    authorised to communicate with the Split API.



    **Before you start:**


    * We use the term **user** below but the user can be a third party or the
    same user that owns the OAuth2 application.

    * As noted below, some access tokens expire every 2 hours. To get a new
    access token use the [refresh grant
    strategy](/#authentication-and-authorisation) to swap a refresh token for a
    new access token.


    1. **Create a Split account**

        If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Split account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash).

    2. **Choose authentication method**

        All requests to the Split API require an `access_token` for authentication. There are two options for obtaining these tokens, the correct option will depend on your use case:

        **Personal access token** If you only need to access your own Split account via the API, then using personal access tokens are the most straight-forward way. Refer to [Personal access token](/#personal-access-token) to setup. These tokens do not expire so no refreshing is required.

        **OAuth grant flow** When you require your application to act on behalf of other Split accounts you'll need to implement the OAuth grant flow process. Refer to [OAuth grant flow guide](/#oauth-grant-flow) to setup. There is also an [OAuth grant flow tutorial](/#oauth-grant-flow-tutorial). These access tokens expire every 2 hours, unless the `offline_access` scope is used in which case the tokens will not expire.

    ## Personal access token

    If you're looking to only access your own account via the API, you can
    generate a personal access token from the UI. These tokens do not expire, but can be deleted.


    * To do this, sign in to your Split account and [create an
    application](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) if you
    haven't already. Click on your application from your [application
    list](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) and click on
    **Personal access**.

        [![Split locate personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)

        _(You'll have the option to give the token a title)_

        [![Split personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)


    * Now that you have an `access_token` you can interact
    with your Split account via the API.

        To do so, you must simply append the access token to the header of any API request: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`



    ## OAuth grant flow

    1. **Register your application with Split**

        Once you've got your account up and running, sign in and create an OAuth2 profile for your application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications)

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | **Name**  | The name of your application. When using the the *Authorisation Grant Flow*, users will see this name as the application requesting access to their account. |
        | **Redirect URI** | Set this to your application's endpoint charged with receiving the authorisation code. |

    2. **Obtain an authorisation code**

        Construct the initial URL the user will need to visit in order to grant your application permission to act on his/her behalf. The constructed URL describes the level of permission ([`scope`](/#scopes)), the application requesting permission (`client_id`) and where the user gets redirected once they've granted permission (`redirect_uri`).

        The URL should be formatted to look like this:
        `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}`

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | `response_type` | Always set to `code` |
        | `client_id` | This is your `Application ID` as generated when you registered your application with Split |
        | `redirect_uri` | URL where the user will get redirected along with the newly generated authorisation code |
        | `scope` | The [scope](/#scopes) of permission you're requesting |

    3. **Exchange the authorisation code for an access token**

        When the user visits the above-mentioned URL, they will be presented with a Split login screen and then an authorisation screen:

        [![Authorise OAuth2 app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)

        After the user has authorised your application, they will be returned to your application at the URL specified in `redirect_uri` along with the `code` query parameter as the authorisation code.

        Finally, the authorisation code can then be exchanged for an access token and refresh token pair by POSTing to: `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/token`

        **Note** The authorisation code is a ONE-TIME use code. It will not work again if you try to POST it a second time.

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | `grant_type` | Set to `authorization_code` |
        | `client_id` | This is your `Application ID` as generated when you registered your application with Split |
        | `client_secret` | This is your `Secret` as generated when you registered your application with Split |
        | `code` | The authorisation code returned with the user (ONE-TIME use) |
        | `redirect_uri` | Same URL used in step 3 |

    4. **Wrap-up**

        Now that you have an access token and refresh token, you can interact with the Split API as the user related to the access token.
        To do so, you must simply append the access token to the header of any API request: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`


    ## OAuth grant flow tutorial

    The OAuth grant flow process is demonstrated using Postman in the steps
    below.


    Before you start, load up our API collection:


    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.postman.co/run-collection/46835ea325243f7bcb26#?env%5BSplit%20Payments%20Public%20Sandbox%5D=W3sia2V5Ijoic2l0ZV9ob3N0IiwidmFsdWUiOiJodHRwczovL2dvLnNhbmRib3guc3BsaXQuY2FzaCIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5IjoiYXBpX2hvc3QiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnNhbmRib3guc3BsaXQuY2FzaCIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5Ijoib2F1dGgyX2FwcGxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIiwidmFsdWUiOiIiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlfSx7ImtleSI6Im9hdXRoMl9zZWNyZXQiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IiIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5Ijoic2NvcGUiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6InB1YmxpYyBhZ3JlZW1lbnRzIGJhbmtfYWNjb3VudHMgYmFua19jb25uZWN0aW9ucyBjb250YWN0cyBwYXltZW50cyBwYXltZW50X3JlcXVlc3RzIHJlZnVuZF9yZXF1ZXN0cyB0cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMgcmVmdW5kcyBvcGVuX2FncmVlbWVudHMgb2ZmbGluZV9hY2Nlc3MiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlfSx7ImtleSI6Imlzbzg2MDFfbm93IiwidmFsdWUiOiIyMDIwLTExLTExVDIzOjU1OjE5WiIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5IjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwidmFsdWUiOiIiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlfSx7ImtleSI6InJlZnJlc2hfdG9rZW4iLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IiIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9XQ==)


    **A screencast of this process is also available:
    [https://vimeo.com/246203244](https://vimeo.com/246203244).**


    1. **Create a Split account**

        If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Split account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash)

    2. **Register your application with Split**

        Sign in and create an OAuth2 application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications).

        Use the special Postman callback URL: `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`

        [![Split OAuth2 app setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_setup.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_setup.png)

    3. **In Postman, setup your environment variables**

        We've included the **Split Payments Public Sandbox** environment to get you started. Select it in the top right corner of the window then click the <img class="inline-1" alt="Postman Quick-Look icon" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_quick_look_icon.png" /> icon and click **edit**.


        [![Edit Postman environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_edit_environment.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_edit_environment.png)

        Using the details from the OAuth2 app you created earlier, fill in the **oauth2_application_id** & **oauth2_secret** fields.

        [![Fill in environment values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_environment_values.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_environment_values.png)

    4. **Setup the authorization**

        Click on the **Authorization** tab and select **OAuth 2.0**

        [![Postman Authorization tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_authorization_tab.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_authorization_tab.png)

        Click the **Get New Access Token** button

        [![Postman get new access token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_get_new_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_get_new_access_token.png)

        Fill in the OAuth2 form as below:

        [![Postman OAuth2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_oauth2_form.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_oauth2_form.png)

    5. **Get authorised**

        Click **Request Token** and wait a few seconds and a browser window will popup

        Sign in with your Split account (or any other Split account you want to authorise).

        [![Signin Split to authorise via OAuth2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_signin.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_signin.png)

        Click **Authorise** to allow the app to access the signed in account. Once complete, Postman will automatically exchange the authorisation code it received from Split for the `access_token/refresh_token` pair. It will then store the `access_token/refresh_token` for you to use in subsequent API requests. The `access_token` effectively allows you to send requests via the API as the user who provided you authorisation.

        [![Authorise OAuth2 app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)

    6. **You're now ready to use the API**

        Select an endpoint from the Split collection from the left hand side menu. Before you send an API request ensure you select your access token and Postman will automatically add it to the request header.

        [![Postman use token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_token.png)

    <aside class="notice">Remember to select the access token everytime you try
    a new endpoint. Have fun!</aside>


    ## Authentication and Authorisation


    Split uses OAuth2 over https to manage authentication and authorisation.


    OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external applications request permission from
    another Split user to send requests on their behalf without getting their
    password.

    This is preferred over Basic Authentication because access tokens can be
    limited by scope and can be revoked by the user at any time.


    New to OAuth2? DigitalOcean has a fantastic 5 minute [introduction to
    OAuth2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2#grant-type-authorization-code).


    We currently support the **authorisation code** and **refresh token**
    grants.


    ### Authorisation Code Grant

    This type of grant allows your application to act on behalf of a user. If
    you've ever used a website or application with your

    Google, Twitter or Facebook account, this is the grant being used.


    See the [Get Started guide](/#get-started) for step by step details on how
    to use this grant.


    ### Refresh Token Grant


    > Code sample


    ```

    curl -F "grant_type=refresh_token" \
         -F "client_id={{oauth2_application_id}}" \
         -F "client_secret={{oauth2_application_secret }}" \
         -F "refresh_token={{refresh_token}}" \
         -X POST https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/token
    ```


    > Example response


    ```json

    {
        "access_token": "ad0b5847cb7d254f1e2ff1910275fe9dcb95345c9d54502d156fe35a37b93e80",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "expires_in": 7200,
        "refresh_token": "cc38f78a5b8abe8ee81cdf25b1ca74c3fa10c3da2309de5ac37fde00cbcf2815",
        "scope": "public"
    }

    ```


    When using the authorisation code grant above, Split will return a `refresh
    token` along with the access token. Access tokens are short lived and last 2
    hours but refresh tokens do not expire.


    When the access token expires, instead of sending the user back through the
    authorisation flow you can use the refresh token to retrieve a new access
    token with the same permissions as the old one.


    <aside class="notice">
      The <code>refresh_token</code> gets regenerated and sent alongside the new <code>access_token</code>. In other words, <code>refresh_token</code>s are single use so you'll
    want to store the newly generated <code>refresh_token</code> everytime you
    use it to get a new <code>access_token</code>

    </aside>

    ## Making payments

    In order to payout funds, you'll be looking to use the
    [Payments](/#Split-API-Payments) endpoint. Whether you're paying out another
    Split account holder or anyone, the process is the same:


    1. Add the recipient to your Contacts: [Split
    Contact](/#add-a-split-contact) or [Anyone Contact](/#add-an-anyone-contact)

    2. [Make the Payment](/#make-a-payment) to your Contact.


    Common use cases:


    * Automated payout disbursement (Referal programs, net/commission payouts,
    etc...)


    ## Getting paid

    There are 2 ways to get paid:


    ### POSTing a [Payment Request](/#Split-API-Payment-Requests)


    Provides the ability to send a Payment Request (get paid) to any Contact
    that is either:


    * A Split Contact (The contact has a Split account); **or**

    * An Anyone Contact (The contact does not have a Split account) with an
    accepted Agreement in place.


    **For a Split Contact**:


    * They will receive a request that they must approve via the Split UI or API
    in order for the funds to flow from their bank account to yours.


    * To automate the Payment Request approval, process you must first [enter
    into an Agreement](/#Split-API-Agreements) with the Split Contact. Once the
    Agreement is accepted, any future Payment Request will be automatically
    approved and processed per the Agreement terms.


    **For an Anyone Contact**:


    * To send a Payment Request using the API to an Anyone Contact, you must
    first have an accepted Agreement with them . To do so, you can send them an
    [Open Agreement link](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) or
    [Unassigned Agreement
    link](http://help.split.cash/agreements/unassigned-agreement) for them to
    [elect & verify their bank
    account](https://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav)
    and accept the Agreement.


    Common use cases:


    * Subscriptions

    * On-account balance payments

    * Bill smoothing

    * Repayment plans


    Example flow embedding an [Open Agreement
    link](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) using an iFrame in
    order to automate future Payment Request approvals:


    [![Hosted Open
    Agreement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/host_oa.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/host_oa.png)


    ### Sharing an [Open Payment
    Request](http://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests)


    Provides the ability to get paid once-off by a anyone whether they are a
    Split account holder or not.


    Usage notes:


    * Utilise a [customisable hosted Payment Request
    form](http://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests) that
    takes care of everything from confirming the payer's bank account access to
    the transfer of funds.

    * The Open Payment Request link can be shared and sit as a secure form
    either outside your app or embeded within via iframe with the ability to
    whitelabel.

    * The URL for the form contains all the customisation parameters enabling
    you to generate the form on the fly.


    Common use cases:


    * Online or offline purchases (eCommerce, fundraiser, etc...)

    * Invoice payment

    * Group funding (paying for a restaurant bill)


    Example flow embedding the [Open Payment
    Request](https://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests)
    link using an iFrame:

    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "title": "Duplicate idempotency key",
          "detail": "A resource has already been created with this idempotency key",
          "links": {
            "about": "https://docs.split.cash/"
          },
          "meta": {
            "resource_ref": "PB.1a4"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    ```


    The Split API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without
    accidentally performing the same operation twice.

    For example, if a [Payment](#Split-API-Payments) is `POST`ed and a there is
    a network connection error, you can retry the Payment with the same
    idempotency key to guarantee that only a single Payment is created.


    To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key:
    <key>` header to the request.

    You can pass any value as the key but we suggest that you use [V4
    UUIDs](https://www.uuidtools.com/generate/v4) or another appropriately random
    string.


    Keys expire after 24 hours. If there is a subsequent request with the same
    idempotency key within the 24 hour period, we will return a `409 Conflict`.


    * The `meta.resource_ref` value is the reference of the resource that was
    previously created with the conflicting idempotency key.

    * The `Idempotency-Key` header is optional but recommended.

    * Only the `POST` action for the Payments, Payment Requests and Refunds endpoints
    support the use of the `Idempotency-Key`.

    * Endpoints that use the `GET` or `DELETE` actions are idempotent by nature.

    * A request that quickly follows another with the same idempotency key may return
    with `503 Service Unavailable`. If so, retry the request after the number of seconds
    specified in the `Retry-After` response header.


    ## Error responses


    > Example detailed error response


    ```json

    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "title": "A Specific Error",
          "detail": "Details about the error",
          "links": {
            "about": "https://docs.split.cash/..."
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    ```

    > Example resource error response


    ```json

    {
      "errors": "A sentence explaining error/s encounted"
    }

    ```

    The Split API returns two different types of error responses depending on the context.


    **Detailed error responses** are returned for:


    * Authentication

    * Request types

    * Idempotency


    All other errors relating to Split specific resources(e.g. Contacts) will return the **Resource error response** style.

    <div class="middle-header">403 errors</div>


    **403 errors** are generally returned from any of our endpoints if your
    application does not have the required authorisation. This is usually due to:


    * An [invalid/expired `access_token`](/#authentication-and-authorisation); or

    * The required **scopes** not being present when setting up your [OAuth application](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications); or

    * The required **scopes** not being present in the [authorisation code link](/#oauth-grant-flow) used to present your user with an authorisation request.


    ## Speeding up onboarding

    Consider the following scenario:


    <blockquote class="main-quote">Split is integrated in your application to
    handle payments.<br>A customer would like to use Split but does not yet have
    Split account.<br>You already have some information about this
    customer.</blockquote>


    Given the above, in a standard implementation where a customer enables/uses
    Split within your application, these are the steps they would follow:


    1. Click on some sort of button within your app to use Split.

    2. They get redirected to the Split sign in page (possibly via a popup or
    modal).

    3. Since they don't yet have a Split account, they would click on sign up.

    4. They would fill in all their signup details and submit.

    5. They would be presented with the [authorisation
    page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png).

    6. They would click the "Authorise" button and be redirected to your app.


    Whilst not too bad, we can do better!


    In order to speed up the process, we allow query string params to be
    appended to the [authorisation URL](/#get-started). For instance, if we
    already have some information about the customer and know they probably
    don't have a Split account, we can embed this information in the
    authorisation URL.


    **Supported query string parameters**


    | Parameter | Description |

    |-----------|--------|

    | `landing`   | Accepted value: `sign_up`.
    What page the user should see first if not already signed in. Default is the
    sign in page.
    <br><br>Deprecated values: `business_sign_up`, `personal_sign_up`.|

    | `nickname` | Only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores are permitted.
    This will be used to identify the account in Split. |

    | `name` | Business account only. Business name. |

    | `abn` | Business account only. Business ABN. |

    | `phone` | Business account only. Business phone number. |

    | `street_address` | |

    | `suburb` | |

    | `state` | See the sign up page for accepted values |

    | `postcode` | |

    | `first_name` | |

    | `last_name` | |

    | `mobile_phone` | |

    | `email` | |


    All values should be [URL
    encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#URL_encoding).


    As an example, the following authorisation URL would display the **personal
    sign up** & prefill the first name field with **George**:

    `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=xxx&scope=xxx&landing=sign_up&first_name=George`


    You can also pass the values directly to the sign up page outside of the
    OAuth2 authorisation process. Click on the following link to see the values
    preloaded:
    [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/business/sign_up?name=GeorgeCo&nickname=georgeco&first_name=George](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/business/sign_up?name=GeorgeCo&nickname=georgceco&first_name=George).


    # Sandbox Testing Details

    Try out your happy paths and not-so happy paths, the sandbox is a great place to get started without transferring actual funds. All transactions are simulated and no communication with financial institutions is performed.


    The sandbox works on a 1 minute cycle to better illustrate how transactions are received and the lifecyle they go through. In other words, every minute, we simulate communicating with financial institutions and update statuses and events accordingly.


    All 6 digits BSBs are valid in the sandbox with the exception of `100000` which is a place keeper for an invalid BSB. In production, only real BSBs are accepted.

    ## Transaction failures

    To simulate [transaction failures](#failure-reasons) create a Payment or Payment Request with a specific amount listed in the table.


    | Transaction failure reason | Debit | Credit |

    |----------------------------|-------|--------|

    | `invalid_bsb_number`       |  $0.01  |  $0.51   |

    | `account_closed`           |  $0.02  |  $0.52   |

    | `customer_deceased`        |  $0.03  |  $0.53   |

    | `incorrect_account_number` |  $0.04  |  $0.54   |

    | `refer_to_split`           |  $0.05  |  $0.55   |

    | `user_voided`              |  $0.06  |  $0.56   |

    | `admin_voided`             |  $0.07  |  $0.57   |

    | `refer_to_customer`        |  $0.10  |          |

    | `insufficient_funds`       |  $0.11  |          |

    | `payment_stopped`          |  $0.12  |          |


    ### Example scenarios

      1. Pay a contact with an invalid account number:
        * Initiate a Payment for <code>$0.54</code>.
        * Split will mimic a successful debit from your bank account.
        * Split will mimic a failure to credit the contact's bank account.
        * Split will automatically create a <code>payout_reversal</code> credit transaction back to your bank account.
      2. Pay a contact whilst having insufficient funds:
        * Initiate a Payment for <code>$0.11</code>.
        * Split will mimic a failure to debit your bank account.
        * Split will mark the debit as `returned` due to `insufficient_funds`.
        * Split will void the scheduled credit to the contact's bank account.
      3. Request payment from a contact with a closed bank account:
        * Initiate a Payment Request for <code>$0.02</code>.
        * Split will mimic a failure to debit the contact's bank account.

    ## NPP payment failures

    If you are utilising an [Account Float](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4275280-utilising-an-account-float) 
    to create NPP payments, you can simulate a transaction that fails to process through the NPP channel by
    [creating a Payment from your account float](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4275293-transacting-from-your-account-float)
    for one of the following amounts.


    | Transaction failure reason | Failure details | Amount |

    |----------------------------|-----------------|---------|

    | `refer_to_split`           | Real-time payment service currently unavailable |  $1.55  |

    | `refer_to_customer`        | Real-time payment rejected by recipient |  $1.60  |

    You will receive all the same notifications as if this happened in our live environment. We recommend you
    check out our article on [what happens when an NPP Payment fails](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4405560-what-happens-when-an-npp-payment-fails) 
    to learn more about what happens when an NPP Payment is unable to process.

    ## Special accounts

    There are some accounts with a special behaviour. You can add them to your Contacts by nickname or bank details.


    | Account nickname | Branch code (BSB) | Account number | Description |

    |---|---|---|---|

    | accept_agreements | `900000` | `99999` | Always accepts agreements |

    | decline_agreements | `900001` | `99999` | Always declines agreements |


    ### (Deprecated) Payment credit failure bank accounts

    You can send Payments to the following reserved bank accounts to trigger specific failures on the credit side.


    | Failure type             | Branch code (BSB) | Account number |

    |--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|

    | `account_closed`           | `300000`          | `99999`        |

    | `customer_deceased`        | `400000`          | `99999`        |

    | `incorrect_account_number` | `500000`          | `99999`        |

    | `refer_to_split`           | `700000`          | `99999`        |


    ### (Deprecated) Payment Request failure bank accounts

    You can send Payment Requests to the following reserved bank accounts to trigger specific failures.


    | Failure type             | Branch code (BSB) | Account number |

    |--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|

    | `payment_stopped`          | `200000`          | `99999`        |

    | `account_closed`           | `300000`          | `99999`        |

    | `customer_deceased`        | `400000`          | `99999`        |

    | `incorrect_account_number` | `500000`          | `99999`        |

    | `refer_to_customer`        | `600000`          | `99999`        |

    | `refer_to_split`           | `700000`          | `99999`        |

    | `insufficient_funds`       | `800000`          | `99999`        |


    By default, all Agreements sent to Contacts with a failure bank account will be automatically accepted.


    ## Instant account verification accounts

    When using any of our hosted solutions ([Payment
    Requests](https://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests),
    [Open Agreements](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) or
    [Unassigned
    Agreements](http://help.split.cash/agreements/unassigned-agreement)) you may
    want to test the [Instant Account Verification
    (IAV)](http://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav)
    process where we accept online banking credentials to validate bank account
    access. To do so, you can use the following credentials:


    | Login | Password |

    |-------|----------|

    | `12345678` | `TestMyMoney` |


    <aside class="notice">The credentials will work with any of the available
    financial institutions.</aside>

    ## Available balances in the Sandbox

    If your integration includes allowing us to pre-fail transactions prior to being processed, you may want to test that your system is handling these events correctly. A transaction will pre-fail when the available balance of the customers account is less than the amount of the payment being requested. This is checked during pre-processing just before your debit is sent for processing if there is an active bank connection.


    In the Sandbox environment, if the contact you are attempting to debit has a bank connection that was created through our Instant Account Verification feature, the available balance of their bank account will always be `$123.45`. Any payment requests above this amount will pre-fail and any amount less than or equal to this amount will succeed.

    # Configuration

    ## Scopes

    Scopes define the level of access granted via the OAuth2 authorisation
    process. As a best practice, only use the scopes your application will
    require.


    | Scope | Description |

    |--------|------------|

    | `public` | View user's public information |

    | `agreements` | Manage user's Agreements |

    | `bank_accounts` | Manage user's Bank Accounts |

    | `bank_connections` | Manage user's Bank Connections |

    | `contacts` | Manage user's Contacts |

    | `open_agreements` | Manage user's Open Agreements |

    | `payments` | Manage user's Payments |

    | `payment_requests` | Manage user's Payment Requests |

    | `refunds` | Manage user's Refunds |

    | `transactions` | Access user's Transactions |

    | `offline_access` | Create non-expiring access tokens for user |

      <aside class="notice">Please use `offline_access` with discretion, as you'll have no direct way to invalidate the token. Please contact Split Payments immediately if any token may have potentially been compromised.</aside>

    ## Pagination


    > Example response header


    ```

    Link: <http://api.sandbox.split.cash/contacts?page=5>; rel="last",
    <http://api.sandbox.split.cash/contacts?page=2>; rel="next"

    Per-Page: 25

    Total: 5

    ```


    All collections are paginated to 25 items by default and the pagination
    information may be found in the response header. You can customise the pagination by appending `?per_page=x` and/or `?page=x` to the endpoint URL.


    <aside class="notice">The maximum <code>per_page</code> value is <code>100</code>. Any value above this will be ignored and <code>100</code> will be used instead.</aside>


    ## Remitter


    > Example request


    ```json

    {
      "...": "...",
      "metadata": {
       "remitter": "CustomRem"
       }
    }

    ```


    You can elect to assign a remitter name on a per-request basis when
    submitting Payments & Payment Requests. Simply append the `remitter` key and
    a value within the `metadata` key.


    * **For Payments**, the party being credited will see the designated
    remitter name along the entry on their bank statement.

    * **For Payment Requests**, the party being debited will see the designated
    remitter name along the entry on their bank statement.


    <aside class="notice">The remitter name MUST be between <code>3</code> and <code>16</code>
    characters.</aside>


    ## Aggregation


    Split will automatically aggregate debits that are:


    - From the same bank account; and

    - Initiated by the same Split account.


    Likewise for credits:


    - To the same bank account; and

    - Initiated by the same Split account.


    Should you prefer aggregation to be disabled, please contact
    [support@splitpayments.com.au](mailto:support@splitpayments.com.au). Note
    that additional charges may apply.


    ## Webhooks


    > Example response


    ```json

    {
      "event": {
        "type": "object.action",
        "at": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
        "who": {
          "account_id": "x",
          "bank_account_id": "x"
        }
      },
      "data": [
        {}
      ]
    }

    ```

    Please refer to our help centre [article on webhooks](http://help.split.cash/en/articles/3303626-webhooks) for more information and an overview of what you can achieve with webhooks.


    We support two main categories of webhooks:


    1. **Owner**: These webhooks are managed by the owner of the Split account
    and only report on events owned by the Split account.

    2. **App**: These webhooks are managed by the Split OAuth2 application owner
    and will report on events relating to any authorised Split account (limited
    by scope).


    | Name | Type | Required | Description |

    |-|-|-|-|

    | event | object | true | Webhook event details |

    | » type | string | true | The webhook event key (list available in the webhook settings) |

    | » at | string(date-time) | true | When the event occurred |

    | » who | object | true | Who the webhook event relates to |

    | »» account_id | string(uuid) | true | The Split account who's the owner of the event |

    | »» bank_account_id | string(uuid) | true | The above Split account's bank account |

    | data | [object] | true | Array of response bodies |


    ### Data schemas

    Use the following table to discover what type of response schema to expect for for the `data.[{}]` component of the webhook delivery.


    | Event                    | Data schema                                                               |

    |--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    | `agreement.*`            | [GetAnAgreementResponse](/#schemagetagreementresponse)                    |

    | `contact.*`              | [GetAContactResponse](/#schemagetacontactresponse)                        |

    | `credit.*`               | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |

    | `creditor_debit.*`       | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |

    | `debit.*`                | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |

    | `debtor_credit.*`        | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |

    | `open_agreement.*`       | [ListAllOpenAgreementsRespose](/#schemalistallopenagreementsresponse)     |

    | `payment.*`              | [GetAPaymentResponse](/#schemagetapaymentresponse)                        |

    | `payment_request.*`      | [GetAPaymentRequestResponse](/#schemagetapaymentrequestresponse)          |

    | `unassigned_agreement.*` | [GetAnUnassignedAgreementResponse](#schemagetunassignedagreementresponse) |


    ### Our Delivery Promises

    1. We only consider a webhook event delivery as failed if we don't receive any http response code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx, etc.)

    2. We will auto-retry failed deliveries every 5 minutes for 1 hour.

    3. Delivery order for webhook events is not guaranteed.

    4. We guarantee at least 1 delivery attempt.


    ### Request ID


    > Example header


    ```

    Split-Request-ID: 07f4e8c1-846b-5ec0-8a25-24c3bc5582b5

    ```


    Split provides a `Split-Request-ID` header in the form of a `UUID` which
    uniquely identifies a webhook event. If the webhook event is
    retried/retransmitted by Split, the UUID will remain the same. This allows
    you to check if a webhook event has been previously handled/processed.


    ### Checking Webhook Signatures


    > Example header


    ```

    Split-Signature:
    1514772000.93eee90206280b25e82b38001e23961cba4c007f4d925ba71ecc2d9804978635

    ```


    Split signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoints. We do so by
    including a signature in each event’s `Split-Signature` header. This allows
    you to validate that the events were indeed sent by Split.


    Before you can verify signatures, you need to retrieve your endpoint’s
    secret from your Webhooks settings. Each endpoint has its own unique secret;
    if you use multiple endpoints, you must obtain a secret for each one.


    The `Split-Signature` header contains a timestamp and one or more
    signatures. All separated by `.` (dot).


    > Example code


    ```sh

    # Shell example is not available

    ```


    ```go

    package main

    import (
        "crypto/hmac"
        "crypto/sha256"
        "strings"
        "fmt"
        "encoding/hex"
    )

    func main() {
        secret := "1234"
        message := "full payload of the request"
        splitSignature := "1514772000.f04cb05adb985b29d84616fbf3868e8e58403ff819cdc47ad8fc47e6acbce29f"

        data := strings.Split(splitSignature, ".")
        timestamp, givenSignature := data[0], data[1]

        signedPayload := timestamp + "." + message

        hash := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
        hash.Write([]byte(signedPayload))
        expectedSignature := hex.EncodeToString(hash.Sum(nil))

        fmt.Println(expectedSignature)

    secret = bytes('1234').encode('utf-8')

    message = bytes('full payload of the request').encode('utf-8')


    data = split_signature.split('.')

    **Step 1. Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header**


    Split the header, using the `.` (dot) character as the separator, to get a
    list of elements.


    | Element | Description |

    |---------|-------------|

    | `timestamp` | [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in
    seconds when the signature was created |

    | `signature` | Request signature |

    | `other`     | Placeholder for future parameters (currently not used) |


    **Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string**


    You achieve this by concatenating:


    - The timestamp from the header (as a string)

    - The character `.` (dot)

    - The actual JSON payload (request body)


    **Step 3: Determine the expected signature**


    Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoint’s signing
    secret as the key, and use the `signed_payload` string as the message.


    **Step 4: Compare signatures**


    Compare the signature in the header to the expected signature. If a
    signature matches, compute the difference between the current timestamp and
    the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your
    tolerance.


    To protect against timing attacks, use a constant-time string comparison to
    compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.

    description: >
      An Agreement is an arrangement between two parties that allows them to
      agree on terms for which future Payment Requests will be auto-approved.


      Split Agreements are managed on a per Contact basis and are
      unidirectional. In other words, if both parties wish for auto-approved
      Payment Requests, they must each propose an Agreement to the other.


      If a Payment Request is sent for an amount that exceeds the terms of the
      agreement, it will need to be manually approved by the recipient.

      Please refer to the [What is an Agreement](http://help.split.cash/articles/3094575-what-is-an-agreement) article in our knowledge base for an overview.

      <div class="middle-header">Direction</div>


      Agreements are therefore broken up by direction:


      1. **Incoming:** Agreement received from another Split account

      2. **Outgoing:** Agreement sent to another Split account


      ##Lifecycle


      An Agreement can have the following statuses:


      | Status | Description |

      |-------|-------------|

      | `proposed` | Waiting for the Agreement to be accepted or declined. |

      | `accepted` | The Agreement has been accepted and is active. |

      | `cancelled` | The Agreement has been cancelled (The initiator or
      authoriser can cancel an Agreement). |

      | `declined` | The Agreement has been declined. |

      | `expended` | The Agreement has been expended (Only for [single_use Unassigned Agreements](/#Split-API-Unassigned-Agreements)). |

  - name: Open Agreements
    description: >
      An Open Agreement is essentially an Agreement template with no specific
      authoriser. Each time an Open Agreement is accepted by either a Split
      account holder or anyone, the authoriser is added to your Contacts list
      and a new Agreement is automatically created between the Open Agreement
      initiator and the authoriser.


      An Open Agreement can be accepted multiple times by different parties and
      the result is the same: A new Agreement. Additionally, an Open Agreement
      can be accepted by anybody, not just other Split users. This is achieved
      by using our [Instant Account Verification
      process](http://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav)
      as part of accepting an [Open

      | `active` | The Open Agreement can be viewed and accepted. |

      | `closed` | The Open Agreement can not be viewed or accepted. |

      A Payment is simply a group of Payouts, therefore it does not have a
      particular status. Its Payouts however have their status regularly
      updated. For a list of possible Payout statuses check out the
      [Transactions](/#Split-API-Transactions).


      When Split is unable to credit funds to a recipient, we will automatically create a payout reversal credit back to the payer. Furthermore, within the payout reversal credit, Split will include details in the `description` and under the `reversal_details` key as to why the original credit to the recipient failed.

      1. **You send a Payment Request to a [Contact](/#Split-API-Contacts) in order to collect funds:**
          1. Given there is an Agreement in place and the Payment Request is within the terms of the Agreement, then it will be automatically approved; **or**
          1. Given the Payment Request is **not** within the terms of the Agreement, then it will not be created; **or**
          1. There is no Agreement in place, then it will not be created.
      1. **Your customer sends funds to you as a [Receivable Contact](/#add-a-receivable-contact):**
          1. A *receivable* Payment Request will be automatically created and approved to identify the movement of funds from your customer to your chosen Split float account.


      ##Lifecycle


      <aside class="notice">Payment Requests generated from a customer sending you funds will always be <code>approved</code> and is not subjet to any prechecking outlined below.</aside>


      A Payment Request can have the following statuses:


      | Status | Description |

      |-------|-------------|

      | `pending_approval` | Waiting for the debtor to approve the Payment Request. |

      | `unverified` | Waiting for available funds response (only applicable when `precheck_funds` enabled). |

      | `approved` | The debtor has approved the Payment Request. |

      | `declined` | The debtor has declined the Payment Request. |

      | `cancelled` | The creditor has cancelled the Payment Request. |


      <div class="middle-header">Prechecking</div>


      Split will automatically check for available funds before **attempting to debit** the debtor. This check is only performed for contacts with an active [bank connection](/#Split-API-Bank-Connections).


      **Prechecking as part of a Payment Request approval**


      When the `precheck_funds` option is enabled, **approval** of a Payment Request will only be allowed when there are sufficient funds. The debtor contact must have a valid agreement and bank connection to make use of this option.


      There are **synchronous** and **asynchronous** lifecycles when the `precheck_funds` option is enabled.


      - When the available funds for a contact's bank account are considered out of date, the API response will return the Payment Request with a state of `unverified` while the bank account data is refreshed. Once the precheck has completed, the Payment Request state will transition to either `approved` or `declined`. This process can be followed by subscribing to the relevant webhook events or regularly polling the Payment Request and verifying its status.

      - When the available funds for a contact are current, the API will respond immediately with a final state of either `approved` or an error message if there are insufficient funds.


      You can gain some control over this process by preemptively telling Split to refresh a contact's available balance at least 1 minute before making a Payment Request. See [Contact balance refresh](/#refresh-contact-bank-connection) for more.

      2. **Outgoing:** An outgoing Refund (you are the issuer of the refund)


      There are two response fields that differ depending on the direction:


      | Field | Description |

      |-------|-------------|

      | `debit_ref` | Only visible to the Refund issuer (outgoing Refunds). This
      reference corresponds to the newly created debit to process the Refund. |

      ##Lifecycle

      | Status | Description |

      |--------|-------------|

      | `maturing` | The maturation date has not yet been reached |

      | `matured` | The maturation date has been reached and the transaction is
      eligible for processing. |

      | `preprocessing` | The transaction is undergoing pre-checks before being sent to the bank. |

      | `processing` | The transaction has been submitted to the bank. |

      | `clearing` | Waiting for confirmation from the bank that the transaction
      has succeeded. |

      | `cleared` | The transaction is complete. |

      | `rejected` | The bank has rejected the transaction due to incorrect bank
      account details. |

      | `returned` | The transaction did not successfully clear. |

      | `voided` | The transaction has been cancelled and is no longer eligible
      for processing. |

      | `pending_verification` | The bank account must be verified before the
      transaction can proceed. |

      | `paused` | The transaction has temporary been paused by Split pending
      internal review. |

      | `prefailed` | The transaction was never submitted to the bank because we
      detected that there were insufficient funds. The transaction can be
      retried. |
