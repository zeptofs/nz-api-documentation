Zepto allows you to make, get and manage payments using nothing but bank accounts.

It is important to understand that there are 2 main ways Zepto can be used for maximum flexibility:

1. Between Zepto accounts.
2. Between a Zepto account and anyone.

Due to the above, certain endpoints and techniques will differ slightly depending on who you are interacting with. You can find more on this in the [Making payments](/#making-payments) and [Getting paid](/#getting-paid) guides.

And for all kinds of How To's and Recipes, head on over to our [Help Guide](https://help.split.cash/en/).
<div class="middle-header">Conventions</div>

* Authentication is performed using OAuth2. See the [Get started](/#get-started) and [Authentication & Authorisation](/#authentication-and-authorisation) guides for more.
* All communication is via `https` and supports **only** `TLSv1.2`.
* Production API: `https://api.split.cash/`.
* Production UI: `https://go.split.cash/`.
* Sandbox API: `https://api.sandbox.split.cash/`.
* Sandbox UI: `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/`.
* Data is sent and received as JSON.
* Clients should include the `Accepts: application/json` header in their requests.
* Currencies are represented by 3 characters as defined in [ISO 4217](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php).

## Try it out
The best way to familiarise yourself with our API is by interacting with it.

We've preloaded a collection with all our endpoints for you to use in Postman. Before you start, **import a copy** of our API collection:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/3168734-baa5ff70-4bc2-44d5-9ba6-fcb61839ff41?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D3168734-baa5ff70-4bc2-44d5-9ba6-fcb61839ff41%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D6400ea2b-bb46-421e-a88c-a8625653c35a#?env%5BSplit%20Payments%20Public%20Sandbox%5D=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)

Okay, lets get things setup!

1. **Create a Zepto account**

    If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Zepto account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash)

2. **Register your application with Zepto**

    Sign in and create an OAuth2 application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications).

    [![Zepto OAuth2 app create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_create.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_create.png)

3. **Generate personal access tokens**

    The quickest way to access your Zepto account via the API is using
    personal access tokens. Click on your newly created application from your [application
list](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) and click on **+ Personal Access Token**.

    [![Zepto locate personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)

    _(You'll have the option to give the token a title)_

    [![Zepto personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)

    <aside class="notice">Please note that personal access tokens do not expire.</aside>

4. **Use personal access token in Postman**

    You can use this `access_token` to authorise any requests to the
    Zepto API in Postman by choosing the **Bearer Token** option under
    the **Authorization** tab.

    [![Postman use personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_personal_access_token.png)

5. **Make an API request!**

    You are now ready to interact with your Zepto account via the
    API! Go ahead and send a request using Postman.

    [![Postman use personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_request_response.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_request_response.png)

## Get started
This guide will help you setup an OAuth2 app in order to get authenticated & authorised to communicate with the Zepto API.

**Before you start:**

* We use the term **user** below but the user can be a third party or the same user that owns the OAuth2 application.
* As noted below, some access tokens expire every 2 hours. To get a new access token use the [refresh grant strategy](/#authentication-and-authorisation) to swap a refresh token for a new access token.

1. **Create a Zepto account**

    If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Zepto account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash).

2. **Choose authentication method**

    All requests to the Zepto API require an `access_token` for authentication. There are two options for obtaining these tokens, the correct option will depend on your use case:

    **Personal access token** If you only need to access your own Zepto account via the API, then using personal access tokens are the most straight-forward way. Refer to [Personal access token](/#personal-access-token) to setup. These tokens do not expire so no refreshing is required.

    **OAuth grant flow** When you require your application to act on behalf of other Zepto accounts you'll need to implement the OAuth grant flow process. Refer to [OAuth grant flow guide](/#oauth-grant-flow) to setup. There is also an [OAuth grant flow tutorial](/#oauth-grant-flow-tutorial). These access tokens expire every 2 hours, unless the `offline_access` scope is used in which case the tokens will not expire.

## Personal access token
If you're looking to only access your own account via the API, you can generate a personal access token from the UI. These tokens do not expire, but can be deleted.

* To do this, sign in to your Zepto account and [create an application](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) if you haven't already. Click on your application from your [application list](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications) and click on **Personal access**.

    [![Zepto locate personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_tokens_empty.png)

    _(You'll have the option to give the token a title)_

    [![Zepto personal OAuth2 tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_personal_access_token.png)

* Now that you have an `access_token` you can interact with your Zepto account via the API.

    To do so, you must simply append the access token to the header of any API request: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

## OAuth grant flow
1. **Register your application with Zepto**

    Once you've got your account up and running, sign in and create an OAuth2 profile for your application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications)

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | **Name**  | The name of your application. When using the the *Authorisation Grant Flow*, users will see this name as the application requesting access to their account. |
    | **Redirect URI** | Set this to your application's endpoint charged with receiving the authorisation code. |

2. **Obtain an authorisation code**

    Construct the initial URL the user will need to visit in order to grant your application permission to act on his/her behalf. The constructed URL describes the level of permission ([`scope`](/#scopes)), the application requesting permission (`client_id`) and where the user gets redirected once they've granted permission (`redirect_uri`).

    The URL should be formatted to look like this:
    `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}`

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | `response_type` | Always set to `code` |
    | `client_id` | This is your `Application ID` as generated when you registered your application with Zepto |
    | `redirect_uri` | URL where the user will get redirected along with the newly generated authorisation code |
    | `scope` | The [scope](/#scopes) of permission you're requesting |

3. **Exchange the authorisation code for an access token**

    When the user visits the above-mentioned URL, they will be presented with a Zepto login screen and then an authorisation screen:

    [![Authorise OAuth2 app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)

    After the user has authorised your application, they will be returned to your application at the URL specified in `redirect_uri` along with the `code` query parameter as the authorisation code.

    Finally, the authorisation code can then be exchanged for an access token and refresh token pair by POSTing to: `https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/token`

    **Note** The authorisation code is a ONE-TIME use code. It will not work again if you try to POST it a second time.

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | `grant_type` | Set to `authorization_code` |
    | `client_id` | This is your `Application ID` as generated when you registered your application with Zepto |
    | `client_secret` | This is your `Secret` as generated when you registered your application with Zepto |
    | `code` | The authorisation code returned with the user (ONE-TIME use) |
    | `redirect_uri` | Same URL used in step 3 |

4. **Wrap-up**

    Now that you have an access token and refresh token, you can interact with the Zepto API as the user related to the access token.
    To do so, you must simply append the access token to the header of any API request: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

## OAuth grant flow tutorial
The OAuth grant flow process is demonstrated using Postman in the steps below.

Before you start, load up our API collection:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/3168734-baa5ff70-4bc2-44d5-9ba6-fcb61839ff41?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D3168734-baa5ff70-4bc2-44d5-9ba6-fcb61839ff41%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D6400ea2b-bb46-421e-a88c-a8625653c35a#?env%5BSplit%20Payments%20Public%20Sandbox%5D=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)

**A screencast of this process is also available: [https://vimeo.com/246203244](https://vimeo.com/246203244).**

1. **Create a Zepto account**

    If you haven't already, you'll want to create a sandbox Zepto account at [https://go.sandbox.split.cash](https://go.sandbox.split.cash)

2. **Register your application with Zepto**

    Sign in and create an OAuth2 application: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications).

    Use the special Postman callback URL: `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`

    [![Zepto OAuth2 app setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_setup.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_app_setup.png)

3. **In Postman, setup your environment variables**

    We've included the **Zepto Public Sandbox** environment to get you started. Select it in the top right corner of the window then click the <img class="inline-1" alt="Postman Quick-Look icon" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_quick_look_icon.png" /> icon and click **edit**.

    [![Edit Postman environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_edit_environment.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_edit_environment.png)

    Using the details from the OAuth2 app you created earlier, fill in the **oauth2_application_id** & **oauth2_secret** fields.

    [![Fill in environment values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_environment_values.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_environment_values.png)

4. **Setup the authorization**

    Click on the **Authorization** tab and select **OAuth 2.0**

    [![Postman Authorization tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_authorization_tab.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_authorization_tab.png)

    Click the **Get New Access Token** button

    [![Postman get new access token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_get_new_access_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_get_new_access_token.png)

    Fill in the OAuth2 form as below:

    [![Postman OAuth2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_oauth2_form.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_oauth2_form.png)

5. **Get authorised**

    Click **Request Token** and wait a few seconds and a browser window will popup

    Sign in with your Zepto account (or any other Zepto account you want to authorise).

    [![Sign in Zepto to authorise via OAuth2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_signin.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/split_oauth2_signin.png)

    Click **Authorise** to allow the app to access the signed in account. Once complete, Postman will automatically exchange the authorisation code it received from Zepto for the `access_token/refresh_token` pair. It will then store the `access_token/refresh_token` for you to use in subsequent API requests. The `access_token` effectively allows you to send requests via the API as the user who provided you authorisation.

    [![Authorise OAuth2 app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png)

6. **You're now ready to use the API**

    Select an endpoint from the Zepto collection from the left hand side menu. Before you send an API request ensure you select your access token and Postman will automatically add it to the request header.

    [![Postman use token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_token.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/postman_use_token.png)

<aside class="notice">Remember to select the access token everytime you try a new endpoint. Have fun!</aside>

## Authentication and Authorisation

Zepto uses OAuth2 over https to manage authentication and authorisation.

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external applications request permission from another Zepto user to send requests on their behalf without getting their password.
This is preferred over Basic Authentication because access tokens can be limited by scope and can be revoked by the user at any time.

New to OAuth2? DigitalOcean has a fantastic 5 minute [introduction to OAuth2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2#grant-type-authorization-code).

We currently support the **authorisation code** and **refresh token** grants.

### Authorisation Code Grant
This type of grant allows your application to act on behalf of a user. If you've ever used a website or application with your
Google, Twitter or Facebook account, this is the grant being used.

See the [Get Started guide](/#get-started) for step by step details on how to use this grant.

### Refresh Token Grant

> Code sample

```
curl -F "grant_type=refresh_token" \
     -F "client_id={{oauth2_application_id}}" \
     -F "client_secret={{oauth2_application_secret }}" \
     -F "refresh_token={{refresh_token}}" \
     -X POST https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/token
```

> Example response

```json
{
    "access_token": "ad0b5847cb7d254f1e2ff1910275fe9dcb95345c9d54502d156fe35a37b93e80",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 7200,
    "refresh_token": "cc38f78a5b8abe8ee81cdf25b1ca74c3fa10c3da2309de5ac37fde00cbcf2815",
    "scope": "public"
}
```

When using the authorisation code grant above, Zepto will return a `refresh token` along with the access token. Access tokens are short lived and last 2 hours but refresh tokens do not expire.

When the access token expires, instead of sending the user back through the authorisation flow you can use the refresh token to retrieve a new access token with the same permissions as the old one.

<aside class="notice">
  The <code>refresh_token</code> gets regenerated and sent alongside the new <code>access_token</code>. In other words, <code>refresh_token</code>s are single use so you'll
want to store the newly generated <code>refresh_token</code> everytime you use it to get a new <code>access_token</code>
</aside>
## Making payments
In order to payout funds, you'll be looking to use the [Payments](/#Split-API-Payments) endpoint. Whether you're paying out another Zepto account holder or anyone, the process is the same:

1. Add the recipient to your [Contact](/#add-a-contact) list.
2. [Make a Payment](/#make-a-payment) to your Contact.

Common use cases:

* Automated payout disbursement (Referal programs, net/commission payouts, etc...)
* Wage payments
* Gig economy payments
* Lending
## Getting paid
There are 2 ways to get paid:

### POSTing a [Payment Request](/#Split-API-Payment-Requests)

Provides the ability to send a Payment Request (get paid) to any Contact that is either:

* A Zepto Contact (The contact has a Zepto account); **or**
* An Anyone Contact (The contact does not have a Zepto account) with an accepted Agreement in place.

**For a Zepto Contact**:

* They will receive a request that they must approve via the Zepto UI or API in order for the funds to flow from their bank account to yours.

* To automate the Payment Request approval, process you must first [enter into an Agreement](/#Split-API-Agreements) with the Zepto Contact. Once the Agreement is accepted, any future Payment Request will be automatically approved and processed per the Agreement terms.
Provides the ability to send a Payment Request (get paid) to any of your Contacts as long as there is an accepted Agreement in place.

* To send a Payment Request to a Contact using the API, you must first have an accepted [Agreement](/#Split-API-Agreements) with them. To do so, you can send them an [Open Agreement link](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) or [Unassigned Agreement link](http://help.split.cash/agreements/unassigned-agreement) for them to [elect & verify their bank account](https://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav) and accept the Agreement. Having this in place will allow any future Payment Requests to be automatically approved and processed as per the Agreement terms.

Common use cases:

* Subscriptions
* On-account balance payments
* Bill smoothing
* Repayment plans

Example flow embedding an [Open Agreement link](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) using an iFrame in order to automate future Payment Request approvals:

[![Hosted Open Agreement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/host_oa.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/host_oa.png)

### Sharing an [Open Payment Request](http://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests)

Provides the ability to get paid once-off by a anyone whether they are a Zepto account holder or not.

Usage notes:

* Utilise a [customisable hosted Payment Request form](http://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests) that takes care of everything from confirming the payer's bank account access to the transfer of funds.
* The Open Payment Request link can be shared and sit as a secure form either outside your app or embeded within via iframe with the ability to whitelabel.
* The URL for the form contains all the customisation parameters enabling you to generate the form on the fly.

Common use cases:

* Online or offline purchases (eCommerce, fundraiser, etc...)
* Invoice payment
* Group funding (paying for a restaurant bill)

Example flow embedding the [Open Payment Request](https://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests) link using an iFrame:

[![Hosted Open Payment Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/hosted_opr.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/hosted_opr.png)

## Idempotent requests

> Example response

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Duplicate idempotency key",
      "detail": "A resource has already been created with this idempotency key",
      "links": {
        "about": "https://docs.split.cash/"
      },
      "meta": {
        "resource_ref": "PB.1a4"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The Zepto API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice.
For example, if a [Payment](#Split-API-Payments) is `POST`ed and a there is a network connection error, you can retry the Payment with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single Payment is created.

To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header to the request.
You can pass any value as the key but we suggest that you use [V4 UUIDs](https://www.uuidtools.com/generate/v4) or another appropriately random string.

Keys expire after 24 hours. If there is a subsequent request with the same idempotency key within the 24 hour period, we will return a `409 Conflict`.

* The `meta.resource_ref` value is the reference of the resource that was previously created with the conflicting idempotency key.
* The `Idempotency-Key` header is optional but recommended.
* Only the `POST` action for the Payments, Payment Requests and Refunds endpoints support the use of the `Idempotency-Key`.
* Endpoints that use the `GET` or `DELETE` actions are idempotent by nature.
* A request that quickly follows another with the same idempotency key may return with `503 Service Unavailable`. If so, retry the request after the number of seconds specified in the `Retry-After` response header.

## Error responses

> Example detailed error response

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "A Specific Error",

> Example resource error response

```json
{
  "errors": "A sentence explaining error/s encounted"
}
```
The Zepto API returns two different types of error responses depending on the context.

**Detailed error responses** are returned for:

* Authentication
* Request types
* Idempotency

All other errors relating to Zepto specific resources(e.g. Contacts) will return the **Resource error response** style.
<div class="middle-header">403 errors</div>

**403 errors** are generally returned from any of our endpoints if your application does not have the required authorisation. This is usually due to:

* An [invalid/expired `access_token`](/#authentication-and-authorisation); or
* The required **scopes** not being present when setting up your [OAuth application](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/applications); or
* The required **scopes** not being present in the [authorisation code link](/#oauth-grant-flow) used to present your user with an authorisation request.

## Speeding up onboarding
Consider the following scenario:

<blockquote class="main-quote">Zepto is integrated in your application to handle payments.<br>A customer would like to use Zepto but does not yet have Zepto account.<br>You already have some information about this customer.</blockquote>

Given the above, in a standard implementation where a customer enables/uses Zepto within your application, these are the steps they would follow:

1. Click on some sort of button within your app to use Zepto.
2. They get redirected to the Zepto sign in page (possibly via a popup or modal).
3. Since they don't yet have a Zepto account, they would click on sign up.
4. They would fill in all their signup details and submit.
5. They would be presented with the [authorisation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitpayments/public_assets/master/images/oauth2_app_authorise.png).
6. They would click the "Authorise" button and be redirected to your app.

Whilst not too bad, we can do better!

In order to speed up the process, we allow query string params to be appended to the [authorisation URL](/#get-started). For instance, if we already have some information about the customer and know they probably don't have a Zepto account, we can embed this information in the authorisation URL.

**Supported query string parameters**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|--------|
| `landing`   | Accepted value: `sign_up`. What page the user should see first if not already signed in. Default is the sign in page. <br><br>Deprecated values: `business_sign_up`, `personal_sign_up`.|
| `nickname` | Only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores are permitted. This will be used to identify the account in Zepto. |
| `name` | Business account only. Business name. |
| `abn` | Business account only. Business ABN. |
| `phone` | Business account only. Business phone number. |
| `street_address` | |
| `suburb` | |
| `state` | See the sign up page for accepted values |
| `postcode` | |
| `first_name` | |
| `last_name` | |
| `mobile_phone` | |
| `email` | |

All values should be [URL encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#URL_encoding).

As an example, the following authorisation URL would display the **personal sign up** & prefill the first name field with **George**:
`https://go.sandbox.split.cash/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=xxx&scope=xxx&landing=sign_up&first_name=George`

You can also pass the values directly to the sign up page outside of the OAuth2 authorisation process. Click on the following link to see the values preloaded: [https://go.sandbox.split.cash/business/sign_up?name=GeorgeCo&nickname=georgeco&first_name=George](https://go.sandbox.split.cash/business/sign_up?name=GeorgeCo&nickname=georgceco&first_name=George).

# Sandbox Testing Details
Try out your happy paths and not-so happy paths; the sandbox is a great place to get started without transferring actual funds. All transactions are simulated and no communication with financial institutions is performed.

The sandbox works on a 1 minute cycle to better illustrate how transactions are received and the lifecyle they go through. In other words, every minute, we simulate communicating with financial institutions and update statuses and events accordingly.

All 6 digits BSBs are valid in the sandbox with the exception of `100000`. This BSB allows you to simulate the adding of an invalid BSB. In production, only real BSBs are accepted.
## DE Transaction failures
To simulate [transaction failures](#failure-reasons) create a Payment or Payment Request with a specific amount listed in the table.

| Transaction failure reason | Debit | Credit |
|----------------------------|-------|--------|
| `invalid_bsb_number`       |  $0.01  |  $0.51   |
| `account_closed`           |  $0.02  |  $0.52   |
| `customer_deceased`        |  $0.03  |  $0.53   |
| `incorrect_account_number` |  $0.04  |  $0.54   |
| `refer_to_split`           |  $0.05  |  $0.55   |
| `user_voided`              |  $0.06  |  $0.56   |
| `admin_voided`             |  $0.07  |  $0.57   |
| `refer_to_customer`        |  $0.10  |          |
| `insufficient_funds`       |  $0.11  |          |
| `payment_stopped`          |  $0.12  |          |

### Example scenarios

  1. Pay a contact with an invalid account number:
    * Initiate a Payment for <code>$0.54</code>.
    * Zepto will mimic a successful debit from your bank account.
    * Zepto will mimic a failure to credit the contact's bank account.
    * Zepto will automatically create a <code>payout_reversal</code> credit transaction back to your bank account.
  2. Pay a contact whilst having insufficient funds:
    * Initiate a Payment for <code>$0.11</code>.
    * Zepto will mimic a failure to debit your bank account.
    * Zepto will mark the debit as `returned` due to `insufficient_funds`.
    * Zepto will void the scheduled credit to the contact's bank account.
  3. Request payment from a contact with a closed bank account:
    * Initiate a Payment Request for <code>$0.02</code>.
    * Zepto will mimic a failure to debit the contact's bank account.

## NPP Payment failures
If you are utilising an [Account Float](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4275280-utilising-an-account-float) to create NPP payments, you can simulate a transaction that fails to process through the NPP channel by [creating a Payment from your account float](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4275293-transacting-from-your-account-float) for one of the following amounts.

| Transaction failure reason | Failure details | Amount |
|----------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `refer_to_split`           | Real-time payment service currently unavailable |  $1.55  |
| `refer_to_customer`        | Real-time payment rejected by recipient |  $1.60  |
| `refer_to_customer`        | Real-time payments not available for recipient |  $1.65  |
You will receive all the same notifications as if this happened in our live environment. We recommend you check out our article on [what happens when an NPP Payment fails](https://help.split.cash/en/articles/4405560-what-happens-when-an-npp-payment-fails) to learn more about what happens when an NPP Payment is unable to process.
## Special accounts
There are some accounts with a special behaviour. You can add them to your Contacts by nickname or bank details.

| Account nickname | Branch code (BSB) | Account number | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| accept_agreements | `900000` | `99999` | Always accepts agreements |
| decline_agreements | `900001` | `99999` | Always declines agreements |

### (Deprecated) Payment Request failure bank accounts
You can send Payment Requests to the following reserved bank accounts to trigger specific failures.

| Failure type             | Branch code (BSB) | Account number |
|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `payment_stopped`          | `200000`          | `99999`        |
| `account_closed`           | `300000`          | `99999`        |
| `customer_deceased`        | `400000`          | `99999`        |
| `incorrect_account_number` | `500000`          | `99999`        |
| `refer_to_customer`        | `600000`          | `99999`        |
| `refer_to_split`           | `700000`          | `99999`        |
| `insufficient_funds`       | `800000`          | `99999`        |

By default, all Agreements sent to Contacts with a failure bank account will be automatically accepted.

## Instant account verification accounts
When using any of our hosted solutions ([Payment Requests](https://help.split.cash/payment-requests/open-payment-requests), [Open Agreements](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement) or [Unassigned Agreements](http://help.split.cash/agreements/unassigned-agreement)) you may want to test the [Instant Account Verification (IAV)](http://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav) process where we accept online banking credentials to validate bank account access. To do so, you can use the following credentials:

| Login | Password |
|-------|----------|
| `12345678` | `TestMyMoney` |

<aside class="notice">The credentials will work with any of the available financial institutions.</aside>
## Available balances in the Sandbox
If your integration includes allowing us to pre-fail transactions prior to being processed, you may want to test that your system is handling these events correctly. A transaction will pre-fail when the available balance of the customers account is less than the amount of the payment being requested. This is checked during pre-processing just before your debit is sent for processing if there is an active bank connection.

In the Sandbox environment, if the contact you are attempting to debit has a bank connection that was created through our Instant Account Verification feature, the available balance of any **Transactional** bank account will always be `$123.45`. Any payment requests above this amount will pre-fail and any amount less than or equal to this amount will succeed.
# Configuration
## Scopes
Scopes define the level of access granted via the OAuth2 authorisation process. As a best practice, only use the scopes your application will require.

| Scope | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `public` | View user's public information |
| `agreements` | Manage user's Agreements |
| `bank_accounts` | Manage user's Bank Accounts |
| `bank_connections` | Manage user's Bank Connections |
| `contacts` | Manage user's Contacts |
| `open_agreements` | Manage user's Open Agreements |
| `payments` | Manage user's Payments |
| `payment_requests` | Manage user's Payment Requests |
| `refunds` | Manage user's Refunds |
| `transfers` | Manage user's Transfers |
| `transactions` | Access user's Transactions |
| `offline_access` | Create non-expiring access tokens for user |

  <aside class="notice">Please use `offline_access` with discretion, as you'll have no direct way to invalidate the token. Please contact Zepto immediately if any token may have potentially been compromised.</aside>

## Pagination

> Example response header

```
Link: <http://api.sandbox.split.cash/contacts?page=5>; rel="last", <http://api.sandbox.split.cash/contacts?page=2>; rel="next"
Per-Page: 25
Total: 5
```

All collections are paginated to 25 items by default and the pagination information may be found in the response header. You can customise the pagination by appending `?per_page=x` and/or `?page=x` to the endpoint URL.

<aside class="notice">The maximum <code>per_page</code> value is <code>100</code>. Any value above this will be ignored and <code>100</code> will be used instead.</aside>

## Remitter

> Example request

```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "metadata": {
   "remitter": "CustomRem"
   }
}
```

You can elect to assign a remitter name on a per-request basis when submitting Payments & Payment Requests. Simply append the `remitter` key and a value within the `metadata` key.

* **For Payments**, the party being credited will see the designated remitter name along the entry on their bank statement.
* **For Payment Requests**, the party being debited will see the designated remitter name along the entry on their bank statement.

<aside class="notice">The remitter name MUST be between <code>3</code> and <code>16</code> characters.</aside>

## Aggregation

Zepto will automatically aggregate debits that are:

- From the same bank account; and
- Have the same description; and
- Initiated by the same Zepto account.
Likewise for credits:

- To the same bank account; and
- Have the same description; and
- Initiated by the same Zepto account.

Should you prefer debit aggregation to be disabled, please contact [support@splitpayments.com.au](mailto:support@splitpayments.com.au). Note that additional charges may apply.

## Webhooks

> Example response

```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "object.action",
    "at": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
    "who": {
      "account_id": "x",
      "bank_account_id": "x"
    }
  },
  "data": [
    {}
  ]
}
```
Please refer to our help centre [article on webhooks](http://help.split.cash/en/articles/3303626-webhooks) for more information and an overview of what you can achieve with webhooks.

We support two main categories of webhooks:

1. **Owner**: These webhooks are managed by the owner of the Zepto account and only report on events owned by the Zepto account.
2. **App**: These webhooks are managed by the Zepto OAuth2 application owner and will report on events relating to any authorised Zepto account (limited by scope).

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| event | object | true | Webhook event details |
| » type | string | true | The webhook event key (list available in the webhook settings) |
| » at | string(date-time) | true | When the event occurred |
| » who | object | true | Who the webhook event relates to |
| »» account_id | string(uuid) | true | The Zepto account who's the owner of the event |
| »» bank_account_id | string(uuid) | true | The above Zepto account's bank account |
| data | [object] | true | Array of response bodies |

### Data schemas
Use the following table to discover what type of response schema to expect for for the `data.[{}]` component of the webhook delivery.

| Event                    | Data schema                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agreement.*`            | [GetAnAgreementResponse](/#schemagetagreementresponse)                    |
| `contact.*`              | [GetAContactResponse](/#schemagetacontactresponse)                        |
| `credit.*`               | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |
| `creditor_debit.*`       | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |
| `debit.*`                | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |
| `debtor_credit.*`        | [ListAllTransactionsResponse](/#schemalistalltransactionsresponse)        |
| `open_agreement.*`       | [ListAllOpenAgreementsRespose](/#schemalistallopenagreementsresponse)     |
| `payment.*`              | [GetAPaymentResponse](/#schemagetapaymentresponse)                        |
| `payment_request.*`      | [GetAPaymentRequestResponse](/#schemagetapaymentrequestresponse)          |
| `unassigned_agreement.*` | [GetAnUnassignedAgreementResponse](#schemagetunassignedagreementresponse) |

### Our Delivery Promises
1. We only consider a webhook event delivery as failed if we don't receive any http response code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx, etc.)
2. We will auto-retry failed deliveries every 5 minutes for 1 hour.
3. Delivery order for webhook events is not guaranteed.
4. We guarantee at least 1 delivery attempt.

**For redelivery of webhooks, check out our [Webhook/WebhookDelivery API endpoints](#Zepto-API-Webhooks).**

### Request ID

> Example header

```
Split-Request-ID: 07f4e8c1-846b-5ec0-8a25-24c3bc5582b5
```

Zepto provides a `Split-Request-ID` header in the form of a `UUID` which uniquely identifies a webhook event. If the webhook event is retried/retransmitted by Zepto, the UUID will remain the same. This allows you to check if a webhook event has been previously handled/processed.

### Checking Webhook Signatures

> Example header

```
Split-Signature: 1514772000.93eee90206280b25e82b38001e23961cba4c007f4d925ba71ecc2d9804978635
```

Zepto signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoints. We do so by including a signature in each event’s `Split-Signature` header. This allows you to validate that the events were indeed sent by Zepto.

Before you can verify signatures, you need to retrieve your endpoint’s secret from your Webhooks settings. Each endpoint has its own unique secret; if you use multiple endpoints, you must obtain a secret for each one.

The `Split-Signature` header contains a timestamp and one or more signatures. All separated by `.` (dot).

**Step 1. Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header**

Split the header, using the `.` (dot) character as the separator, to get a list of elements.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in seconds when the signature was created |
| `signature` | Request signature |
| `other`     | Placeholder for future parameters (currently not used) |

**Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string**

You achieve this by concatenating:

- The timestamp from the header (as a string)
- The character `.` (dot)
- The actual JSON payload (request body)

**Step 3: Determine the expected signature**

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoint’s signing secret as the key, and use the `signed_payload` string as the message.

**Step 4: Compare signatures**

Compare the signature in the header to the expected signature. If a signature matches, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.

To protect against timing attacks, use a constant-time string comparison to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Agreements">Agreements</h1>

An Agreement is an arrangement between two parties that allows them to agree on terms for which future Payment Requests will be auto-approved.

Zepto Agreements are managed on a per Contact basis, and if a Payment Request is sent for an amount that exceeds the terms of the agreement, it will not be created.
Please refer to the [What is an Agreement](http://help.split.cash/articles/3094575-what-is-an-agreement) article in our knowledge base for an overview.
<div class="middle-header">Direction</div>

Agreements are therefore broken up by direction:

1. **Outgoing:** Agreement sent to one of your Contacts
2. **Outgoing:** Agreement sent to another Zepto account [Deprecated]
3. **Incoming:** Agreement received from another Zepto account [Deprecated]

##Lifecycle

An Agreement can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `proposed` | Waiting for the Agreement to be accepted or declined. |
| `accepted` | The Agreement has been accepted and is active. |
| `cancelled` | The Agreement has been cancelled (The initiator or authoriser can cancel an Agreement). |
| `declined` | The Agreement has been declined. |
| `expended` | The Agreement has been expended (Only for [single_use Unassigned Agreements](/#Split-API-Unassigned-Agreements)). |

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Bank-Connections">Bank Connections</h1>

Bank connections are read-only connections to your contacts' banking data. This allows Zepto (and yourself) to make intelligent transactional decisions leading to better outcomes.

Use these endpoints to:

  * List your bank connections and check their status
  * Retrieve a link that you can share with your contact to update their invalidated bank connection (e.g Their online banking credentials have changed)

<aside class="notice">To access these endpoints on behalf of another account via OAuth2, your application must request (and the user must authorise) <a href="#configuration">the bank_connections scope</a>.</aside>

`POST /contacts/receivable`

Receive funds from a Contact by allowing them to pay to a personalised PayID or account number. Perfect for reconciling incoming funds to a customer, receiving funds instantly, eliminating human error & improving your customer's experience.

<aside class="notice">
  To enable this feature, please contact our support team with the following information:
    <li>Your full legal business name</li>
    <li>A legally owned domain name: for your PayID email addresses</li>
    <li><strong>alias_name</strong>: the business name that will be displayed to your customers upon PayID resolution. We suggest using a shortened name appropriate for mobile displays</li>
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
  There are two strategies supported for PayID assignment when creating this type of Contact:
  <li><strong>On-demand PayID</strong>: provide a <code>payid_email</code> and we'll create a contact and register a PayID with the given email address. The PayID registration process happens when the request is received. The initial response for <code>payid_details.state</code> will always be <code>pending</code>. It will transition to <code>active</code> when the PayID registration process is complete. This can take up to a few seconds. You can use webhooks to be informed of this state change.</li>
  <li><strong>Pooled PayID</strong>: provide your <code>payid_email_domain</code> and we'll create a contact and assign them a PayID from your pool. Pooled PayIDs are pre-registered. The PayID email value is generated using a random value and the email domain from your PayID pool configuration. Providing both <code>payid_email</code> and <code>payid_email_domain</code> will ignore your pool and use the "On-demand PayID" strategy instead.</li>
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
  While unlikely, it is possible that we will be unable to register the given PayID. In this case <code>payid_details.state</code> will transition to <code>failed</code>.

  You can simulate this path in sandbox by adding <code>+failure</code> to your <code>payid_email</code> e.g <code>test+failure@split.cash</code>
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
  You can test receiving payments to a Receivable Contact in our sandbox environment using the <a href="#simulate-incoming-payid-payment">PayID simulation endpoint</a>.

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Open-Agreements">Open Agreements</h1>

An Open Agreement is essentially an Agreement template with no specific authoriser. Each time an Open Agreement is accepted by either a Zepto account holder or anyone, the authoriser is added to your Contacts list and a new Agreement is automatically created between the Open Agreement initiator and the authoriser.

An Open Agreement can be accepted multiple times by different parties and the result is the same: A new Agreement. Additionally, an Open Agreement can be accepted by anybody, not just other Zepto users. This is achieved by using our [Instant Account Verification process](http://help.split.cash/bank-accounts/instant-account-verification-iav) as part of accepting an [Open Agreement](https://help.split.cash/agreements/open-agreement).
##Lifecycle

An Open Agreement can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `active` | The Open Agreement can be viewed and accepted. |
| `closed` | The Open Agreement can not be viewed or accepted. |

<aside class="notice">When you close an Open Agreement, no new Agreements can be created from it and all past Agreement resulting from the acceptance of the Open Agreement are unaffected.</aside>

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Payment-Requests">Payment Requests</h1>

A Payment Request (PR) is used to collect funds, via direct debit, from one of your Contacts (as long as there is an accepted Agreement in place).

<div class="middle-header">Applicable scenarios</div>

1. **You send a Payment Request to a [Contact](/#Split-API-Contacts) in order to collect funds:**
    1. Given there is an Agreement in place and the Payment Request is within the terms of the Agreement, then it will be automatically approved; **or**
    1. Given the Payment Request is **not** within the terms of the Agreement, then it will not be created; **or**
    1. There is no Agreement in place, then it will not be created.
1. **Your customer sends funds to you as a [Receivable Contact](/#add-a-receivable-contact):**
    1. A *receivable* Payment Request will be automatically created and approved to identify the movement of funds from your customer to your chosen Zepto float account.

##Lifecycle

<aside class="notice">Payment Requests generated from a customer sending you funds will always be <code>approved</code></aside>

A Payment Request can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pending_approval` | Waiting for the debtor to approve the Payment Request. [DEPRECATED] |
| `unverified` | Waiting for available funds response. |
| `approved` | The debtor has approved the Payment Request. |
| `declined` | The debtor has declined the Payment Request. |
| `cancelled` | The creditor has cancelled the Payment Request. |

<div class="middle-header">Prechecking</div>

When using Payment Requests to collect payments from your customer, Zepto will automatically check for available funds before **attempting to debit** the debtor. This check is only performed for contacts with an active [bank connection](/#Split-API-Bank-Connections).

A Payment is used to disburse funds to your Contacts.

Supported payment rails:

* **NPP**: New Payments Platform (Real-time)
* **DE / BECS**: Direct Entry / Bulk Electronic Clearing System (Slower)

A Payment is simply a group of Payouts, therefore it does not have a particular status. Its Payouts however have their status regularly updated. For a list of possible Payout statuses check out the [Transactions](/#Split-API-Transactions).

  <aside class="notice">
    Zepto no longer supports multiple Payouts within a single Payment request. A Payment request must only contain 1 Payout object.
  </aside>

### Payout Reversal
When Zepto is unable to credit funds to a recipient, we will automatically create a payout reversal credit back to the payer. Furthermore, within the payout reversal credit, Zepto will include details in the `description` and under the `reversal_details` key as to why the original credit to the recipient failed.

`POST /payments`

To enable custom payment flows, the required payment channel can be selected by setting the _channel_ attribute to one of the following combinations:

<ul>
  <li>["new_payments_platform"] - for faster payments 24/7/365</li>
  <li>["direct_entry"] - for slower traditional payments</li>
  <li>["new_payments_platform", "direct_entry"] - enables automatic channel switching if a payment fails on the NPP</li>
</ul>

`POST /payouts/{ref}/retry`

When debitting a Contact with an active bank connection, Zepto will first ensure that there are sufficient funds available before submitting the debit to the banks.
If a high probability of insufficient funds is detected, Zepto will not submit the transaction to the banks and will mark the transaction as <strong>Prefailed</strong>.

This endpoint allows you to retry the Payment Request without having to create a brand new transaction.

<aside class="notice">
  Rather than using this endpoint, we now recommend creating a brand new transaction as this simplifies and maintains data integrity for the lifecycle of each attempt

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Transactions">Transactions</h1>

By default, the transactions endpoint provides a detailed look at all past, current and future debits & credits related to your account.

<aside class="notice">Want to also know about the debits & credits applied to the other party? No problem! Use the <code>both_parties=true</code> query string.</aside>

##Lifecycle

A transaction (debit or credit) can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `maturing` | The maturation date has not yet been reached. |
| `matured` | The maturation date has been reached and the transaction is eligible for processing. |
| `preprocessing` | The transaction is undergoing pre-checks before being sent to the bank. |
| `processing` | The transaction has been submitted to the bank. |
| `clearing` | Waiting for confirmation from the bank that the transaction has succeeded. |
| `cleared` | The transaction is complete. |
| `rejected` | The bank has rejected the transaction due to incorrect bank account details. |
| `returned` | The transaction did not successfully clear. |
| `voided` | The transaction has been cancelled and is no longer eligible for processing. |
| `pending_verification` | The bank account must be verified before the transaction can proceed. |
| `paused` | The transaction has temporary been paused by Zepto pending internal review. |
| `prefailed` | The transaction was never submitted to the bank because we detected that there were insufficient funds. The transaction can be retried. |
| `channel_switched` | The initial payment channel has failed and the credit has automatically switched to attempt the payment using the next available channel. |

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `refer_to_customer` | Usually due to insufficient funds |
| `insufficient_funds` | Insufficient funds |
| `payment_stopped` | The payment was stopped at the bank. Can be due to a customer requesting a stop payment with their financial institution. |

| `account_closed` | The bank account is closed |
| `customer_deceased` | Customer is deceased |
| `incorrect_account_number` | Account number is incorrect |

<h1 id="Zepto-API-Unassigned-Agreements">Unassigned Agreements</h1>

An agreement with no preset authoriser that can only be accepted once and must be accepted within a predefined time period.

Unassigned Agreements are shared using the generated link available in the response body. You can then include it in an email, text message, embed it in an iFrame, etc...

Please refer to the [Unassigned Agreement](http://help.split.cash/agreements/unassigned-agreement) article in our knowledge base for more information.
